# GroupChat: coder, runner and examplar

This example is an improved version of [GroupChat: coder and runner](../GroupChatExample.CoderRunner/README.md), it shows how to use a coder agent, a runner agent and an examplar agent on ML.Net related task, and is highlighted with the following feaures:
- Introduce RAG pattern to group chat using examplar agent. The examplar agent retrieves correct code snippet from [MLNET_TASK_101](https://github.com/LittleLittleCloud/MLNet-Task-101) and provides it to the coder agent for reference.
- Introduce context management to group chat. By summarizing the context perioudically and only keeping the latest context in chat session, agents can focus on the most recent information and avoid being confused by outdated information. This feature also reduce the length of chat history and mitigate the token limit issue.
- Notebook generation. a dotnet interactive notebook will be generated after the group chat, which includes all code snippets and can be used for further implemenation or debugging.

To find a generated example, please check [workDir](./workDir/) folder. The worDir folder contains the following files:
- [chat_history.txt](./workDir/chat_history.txt) a sample of the chat history.
- [context.txt](./workDir/context.txt) a sample of the saved context from context management.
- [lgbm.mlnet](./workDir/lgbm.mlnet) mlnet model generated by the group chat.
- [notebook.ipynb](./workDir/notebook.ipynb) a sample of the generated notebook, which includes all code snippets from the group chat.

## Pre-requisites
To run this example, you need to have access to a GPT-0613 model.

To achive the best result, it's sugguested to use GPT-4 series model on some agents, like coder. However, it usually brings more cost and longer latency.

## Disclaimer
This example is for a proof-of-concept purpose only. It's not production ready and not recommended to use in production.

The output result might be vary because the output of GPT is not deterministic.

Cost will be applied to your openai account when you run this example.
